      "value": "<p>The portrait depicts Margaret Pitt, daughter of Robert Pitt of Blandford Forum, Dorset.  Little is known about her, although she appears to have been the sister of the physician, Robert Pitt (1653-1713), professor of anatomy at Oxford, and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians On 15 November 1700 Margaret Pitt married William Lowth [see DH57] at St Bride’s Church, Fleet Street, London. The portrait, which dates to c.1700-10, and is evidently a pendant to DH57, was painted possibly on the occasion of Margaret Pitt’s marriage to William Lowth, and may be by the same artist. </p>"
