      "value": "<p>Thomas Hussey (1639-1706), 2nd Baronet, was baptised on 14 January 1639, the first surviving son of Thomas Hussey (1613-1641), and grandson of Sir Edward Hussey, 1st Baronet, of Honington and Elizabeth Anton, the heiress to Doddington Hall.  Hussey’s mother, Rhoda Chapman (d. 1686), following her husband’s death, married Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Baron Fairfax of Cameron, a commander in the Parliamentary army. Thomas Hussey, sitter in the present portrait, was educated privately at Lincoln School and at Christ’s College, Cambridge. In 1661 married Sarah Langham, daughter of Sir John Langham, 1st Bt. His daughter, Sarah Hussey (1700-49) was heiress to Doddington Hall. Through her marriage to Robert Apreece, Doddington passed to her daughter, Rhoda Apreece, the wife of Captain Francis Blake Delaval.<br><br>On his father’s death in 1641, Thomas Hussey took up residence at Doddington, with an income of about £2,500 per annum. An ardent Royalist, at the Restoration he provided the King with a loan of £60. Hussey served as an army officer, entering the army as an ensign in the Earl of Peterbrough’s regiment, becoming an adjutant in the Duke of York’s regiment.  He also served in the Tangier Regiment on the north west coast of Africa and commanded a cavalry troop at the Battle of Edgemoor in 1685, eventually achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Hussey was also engaged in local and national politics, and in 1668-69 was appointed High Sheriff of Lincolnshire, and served as Member of Parliament for Lincoln and later Lincolnshire during the 1680s and ‘90s. A Tory, and a reluctant supporter of the 1688 Revolution, Hussey died in 19 December 1706, and was buried at the Hussey family seat at Honington.<br><br>The present portrait, in which Hussey would appear to be in his forties, seems to have been enlarged from a ‘three-quarters’ (head and shoulders), measuring c. 30 by 25 inches, to a ‘half-length’, measuring c. 50 by 40 inches.  The presence of what appears to be a sculpted sphinx in the background relates possibly to Hussey’s military campaign in Africa.</p>"
