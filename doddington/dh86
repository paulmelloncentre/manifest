      "value": "<p>This is one of several variants of the three-quarter length portrait of James I by John de Critz the Elder (c.1550-1642).  Others include the versions in the National Maritime Museum (BHC2796) and at Montacute House, presented by James I to the former Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Edward Phelips. De Critz, who came to England from Antwerp as a child, was established as an independent artist by the 1590s. From 1603 he held the appointment of serjeant painter of the king, a post he held jointly with Leonard Fryer and subsequently Robert Peake. The composition has been dated to c.1610, by which time de Critz operated an extensive studio.</p>"
