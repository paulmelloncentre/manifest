      "value": "<p>The portrait has been identified in the past as Anne Stuart (1665-1714) the second daughter of James, Duke of York, later James II, and Anne Hyde. She succeeded William III to the throne as Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland 1702, and in 1707, under the Acts of Union, as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. Although the sitter in the present portrait bears a passing resemblance to Queen Anne, the traditional identification is not convincing.  Nor does the unadorned dress suggest that this is a royal portrait.  On stylistic grounds the portrait would appear to have been painted around 1700. The identity of the artist is unknown.</p>"
