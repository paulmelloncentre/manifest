      "value": "<p>The portrait has been identified as the wealthy merchant Thomas Pitt (known as ‘Diamond Pitt’) (1653-1726). Pitt was born in Blandford Forum, Dorset, son of the Reverend John Pitt and Sarah Jay. He may well have been related to Margaret Pitt, wife of William Lowth, and daughter of Robert Pitt, also of Blandford Forum.  The likeness in the present portrait to the full-length portrait of Thomas Pitt by Kneller (Chevening, Sevenoaks, Kent) is unconvincing. Nor does the characterization and dress of the sitter resemble that of a wealthy merchant.  On stylistic grounds, the portrait would appear to date to circa 1690-1700, and is by an artist in the circle of Kneller.<br><br>A possible identification of the sitter is Robert Pitt (1653-1713), brother of Margaret Pitt, and brother-in-law of William Lowth. Robert Pitt matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, 2 April 1769, and was elected a Fellow of Wadham in 1774, and Dean in 1777. He subsequently taught anatomy at Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 December 1682. Pitt married Martha, daughter of John Nourse, of Wood Eaton, Oxfordshire in 1686, and died in Hatton Garden, London on 13 January 1713. He does not seem to have had any issue.</p>"
