      "value": "<p>The sitter in the portrait is identified here as Sarah Hussey Delaval (1742-1821), daughter of Captain Francis Blake Delaval (d.1752) and Rhoda Apreece (d.1759). Sarah Delaval married John Savile, Lord Pollington (1719-1798) 20 January 1760.  Previously, the portrait had been identified as a portrait of Rhoda Blake Delaval (1725-1757), eldest daughter of Captain Francis Blake Delaval and Rhoda Apreece. However, a comparison with the full-length portrait in the Long Gallery of Sarah Delaval, also attributed to Read, indicates the same sitter in both portraits. Indeed, the similarity extends not only to the facial characteristics but also the expression, suggesting that the present portrait may have served as the model for the more ambitious full-length portrait. An examination of the canvas also suggests that the present portrait was at some stage enlarged on all four sides.</p>"
