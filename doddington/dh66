      "value": "<p>The portrait depicts the clergyman and scholar Robert Eden (1701-1759). Eden  was the son-in-law of William Lowth (1660-1732) and husband of Martha Lowth. Eden’s daughter, Mary, married Ebenezer Blackwell. Robert Eden gained an MA at Oxford University, and was ordained into the priesthood at St Paul’s Cathedral in 1726. He was appointed Rector of St Swithun’s, Headbourne Worthy, Hampshire, in 1739, a position he held until his death. In 1743 he became Archdeacon of Winchester, and in 1749, Prebendary of Winchester and Canon of Worcester. He also served as Chaplain to William, 5th Earl of Coventry. Eden’s liturgical publications included The necessary connexion of truth and love in matters of religion. A sermon preached in the cathedral-church of Winchester, at the visitation of the Worshipful and Reverend Dr. Hoadly, Chancellor of the Diocese of Winchester, on Tuesday, September 24, 1754. He also published a textbook on Comparative law, Jurisprudentia Philologica, Sive Elementa Juris Civilis, Secundum Methodum et Seriem Institutionum Justiniani, In Brevem & Facilem Ordinem Redacta, Notis Classicis, & Historicis, Nec non Parallelis Juris Anglicani Locis, Illustrata. Quibus Accessit Prooemium de Jure Civili Romanorumante Justinianum, Et de Libris Juris Civilis Romanorum per Justinianum Compositis. In Usum Juventutis Academicae, Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, 1744.<br><br>The present bust-length portrait of Eden in clerical vestments, probably dates to circa 1740. The artist is unknown, but can be attributed to the circle of Joseph Highmore. It came to Doddington in the nineteenth century through the Jarvis family.</p>"
