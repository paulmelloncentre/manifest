This appears to echo wider political shifts of the period: after 1965, it became clear that British plans for an independent federation of the West Indies that would incorporate the components of the Leeward and Windward islands that had been under British rule would have to be abandoned. Some in the British political sphere had hoped to terminate the so-called drain that the Leeward and Windward Islands were perceived to be making on “British” resources by offloading them into a federation where they would gain support and stability from their larger, more prosperous neighbours, such as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. The larger islands rejected this proposal."
