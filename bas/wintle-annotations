This appears to echo wider political shifts of the period: after 1965 it became clear that British plans for an independent federation of the West Indies that would incorporate the components of the Leeward and Windward islands that had been under British rule would have to be abandoned. Some in the British political sphere had hoped to terminate the drain that the Leeward and Windward Islands were perceived to be making on ‘British’ resources by offloading them into a federation where they would gain support and stability from their larger, more prosperous neighbours, such as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. The larger islands rejected this proposal.  At the Commonwealth Institute, by 1969, ‘The West Indies’ had been removed from the map and individual islands had gained their own displays."
